_Overview_

Retail stores, museums, and theatres ask visitors to leave their belongings at a counter. In
peak hours, the goods are often misplaced and cause delays. Customers are hassled
when the token is lost. Our project aims to offer a smooth experience by automating this process. We propose a
simple low-cost solution that reliably handles personal belongings.
